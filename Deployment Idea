You want your chatbot to be fully deployed and functional on Vercel, without needing to run localhost:3000 for the frontend or localhost:8000 for the backend. That means:
- ✅ Frontend hosted on Vercel
- ✅ Backend hosted separately and publicly accessible
- ✅ Vercel frontend fetches from the live backend, not your local machine
Let’s make that happen.

🧠 Why It Doesn’t Work Yet
Your frontend is deployed on Vercel, but it’s still trying to fetch from http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat, which only works when your FastAPI backend is running locally. Vercel can’t reach your local machine — it needs a public backend URL.

✅ Step-by-Step: Make It Fully Live
1. 🚀 Deploy Your FastAPI Backend
You can use one of these platforms:
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 


Once deployed, you’ll get a public URL like:
https://polylingua-api.onrender.com/chat



2. 🔧 Update Your Frontend fetch URL
In your page.js, change:
const res = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat", {


to:
const res = await fetch("https://polylingua-api.onrender.com/chat", {


Or better: use an environment variable like NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL.

3. 🛠️ Add .env.local to Your Frontend
Create a file called .env.local in your frontend root:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://polylingua-api.onrender.com


Then update your fetch call:
const res = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/chat`, {



4. 🔁 Redeploy on Vercel
Once your frontend is updated:
- Push changes to GitHub
- Vercel will auto-deploy
- Your live site will now fetch from your live backend

✅ Result
You’ll be able to open:
https://polylingua-ai.vercel.app


And it will:
- Show your chatbot interface
- Handle multilingual input
- Respond via your FastAPI backend
- Work 24/7 — no localhost needed
